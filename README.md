## Unsupervised Image Clustering with K-Medoids

Implemented partitional clusteringÂ using the K-Medoids algorithm to group image data into 3 distinct clusters.

Selected optimal medoids as cluster representatives to minimize intra-class variance.

Validated model effectiveness across two benchmark datasets.

**Key skills:** Unsupervised Learning, Feature Space Optimization, Experimental Validation
